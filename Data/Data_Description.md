# Data Description

The initial part of the project is to define what is rural America. For this, information about the population of cities and town in a state (initially Wisconsin only) and a threshold will be defined to determine what is considered urban and non-urban.

After selecting the small cities and towns in non-urban Wisconsin, their geographical location will be gathered to be used in the Foursquare. An appropriate search query will be sent to get the information of grocery stores in the town.

A database of grocery stores from all over non-urban Wisconsin will be made with the location information and the name of the town they belong to. Additionally, I will have another database with the information about the towns such as population and location.
